                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Settlements</h2>
                <p>In consideration of the Services rendered by us, you shall pay Sailspay a fee ("FEE"). Sailspay
                    reserves the right to revise the Fee periodically and will intimate you of any such change within
                    reasonable time. Sailspay reserves the right to levy additional fees on transactions undertaken
                    through corporate cards. On receipt of the payments in the nodal account, we will endeavour to
                    instruct the nodal bank to transmit the payments payable to the seller, after deducting our Fee or
                    chargebacks or penalties imposed by regulatory authorities not limited to RBI, from the nodal
                    account to the seller's designated bank account, within 3 (three) bank working days (or such other
                    period as may be prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time) from completion of
                    transaction. Subject to any other provisions of these Terms of Use and completion of transaction,
                    the seller acknowledges that we will settle the payments only upon actual receipt of payments in the
                    nodal account and upon reconciliation of the payments by the Acquiring Banks, our payment gateway
                    and the nodal bank. The seller will bear and be responsible and liable for the payment of all
                    relevant taxes in relation to the payments made under these Terms of Use.</p>
                <p>Sellers receive the amount (minus Sailspay's Fee or chargebacks or penalties imposed by regulatory
                    authorities not limited to RBI) in their bank account within T+3 bank working days where T is
                    defined as the date of intimation of the completion of the transaction. Sailspay shall be entitled to
                    charge on the Fee, taxes applicable from time to time ("APPLICABLE TAXES"). It is agreed that any
                    statutory variations in Applicable Taxes during the subsistence of this Agreement shall be borne by
                    the User. Monthly invoices shall be raised by us in respect of the Fees charged for transactions
                    processed during such month. Any reasonable dispute in respect of an amount (or a portion thereof)
                    mentioned in an invoice must be communicated by the User via notice ("INVOICE DISPUTE NOTICE")
                    within a reasonable period of time but no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the
                    invoice. Sailspay shall use good faith efforts to reconcile any reasonably disputed amounts within
                    reasonable time from the receipt of the Invoice Dispute Notice. In respect of invoices received by
                    the Client, it is agreed that if the User pays over applicable taxes under the Indian Income Tax
                    laws and furnishes to us the TRACES certificate in respect of such taxes paid, then we shall
                    reimburse to the User, on a quarterly basis, the amount in respect of such taxes paid. Once a
                    payment is authenticated by payment service providers, money shall be moved to the escrow account
                    and the first settlement shall be initiated only after all required documents (in hard copies) are
                    received by Sailspay. All risks associated with the delivery of the goods or service will solely be
                    that of the seller and not of Sailspay. Also, all disputes regarding quality, merchantability,
                    non-delivery, delay in delivery or otherwise will be directly between the seller and the buyer
                    without making Sailspay and/or the payment service providers, a party to such disputes. Further,

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Transaction Disputes</h2>
                <p>Transactions may be disputed anytime within up to 120 (one hundred twenty) days, from the date of
                    transaction by a buyer, as per the Card Payment Network Rules. Disputes resolved in favour of a
                    buyer may result in reversal of payment to such buyer ("CHARGEBACK"). In the event of
                    rejection/suspension of payments to the seller, chargebacks, refunds and/or any other dispute
                    relating to the transactions contemplated under these Terms of Use ("DISPUTED TRANSACTION"), on any
                    grounds whatsoever, we will forthwith notify the seller of the same. On such notification the seller
                    will conduct an internal review of such matter and will, within 5 (five) working days from receipt
                    of notification, respond to us in writing either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requesting us to refund ("Refund Request") the payment received by the seller in respect of such
                        Disputed Transaction ("Refund Monies"); or</li>
                    <li>Providing us with a statement explaining how the Disputed Transaction is not warranted, together
                        with all documentary evidence in support of contesting such Disputed Transaction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All refunds shall be made to the original method of payment. In the event that the seller provides a
                    Refund Request to us or fails to contest such Disputed Transaction within the aforesaid 5 (five)
                    working days or contests Disputed Transaction without providing supporting documentation to us,
                    payment service providers, Card Payment Network and/or issuing institution's satisfaction, we will
                    be entitled to recover the Refund Monies from credits subsequently made to the escrow account with
                    respect to payments made by the seller's buyers. In the event that we are unable to recover the
                    Refund Monies as aforesaid, due to the amounts credited to the escrow account being lower than the
                    Refund Monies, Sailspay shall be entitled to recover such Refund Monies (or any part thereof) from
                    the User by (i) raising a debit note in respect of such monies; and/or (ii) setting-off the
                    remaining Refund Monies against the future payables to the seller and refund the same to the
                    respective buyers. The seller will be liable to make payment of the Refund Monies or part thereof
                    which has not been recovered by us forthwith. It is hereby agreed and acknowledged by the parties
                    that the Fees charged by us in respect of the Disputed Transaction will not be refunded or repaid by
                    us to the seller, buyer or any other person. Further, the Chargeback will be provided within 1 (one)
                    week of the transaction and the maximum amount of the Chargeback payable by Sailspay to the buyer
                    will be the value of the transaction only.</p>
